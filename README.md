# Road Builder
**In collaboration with Trejak and BadPeanut**

Create endless road combinations on the fly while you’re playing the game!
With a slick and easy-to-use interface, you’ll be able to create the exact road that you need on the spot.

## Features

* Roads are unique and automatically saved when saving your city.
* Each road has its own auto-generate, detailed thumbnail.
* Roads are generated in real time, guaranteeing future compatibility with updates to the game.
* Roads are included in your save-game, allowing you to share it with anyone who has Road Builder with ease.
* You can create asphalt roads, gravel roads, pedestrian roads, highways, all three types of tracks, and pedestrian paths.

## Custom Lanes Support

While Road Builder for C:S II does not have the customization capabilities of its C:S I predecessor, this mod is built to support custom lanes once the asset editor arrives.
This in turn will create endless possibilities and styles for your modular roads. This includes different sizes, textures, and functionalities… 



## FAQ
**How do you create roads?
All roads start from an existing network. You have to place a segment to then edit it.
This partially dictates how the generated road looks and behaves, but you'll always be able to change those settings later.

### What then? do I have to edit every segment on my map?
No, when you create a road, it is generated as a whole new asset which you can find and use from the road toolbar or the Custom Roads List.
You can also use the Road Builder tool to 'Place More' of the custom roads you created.

### What happens if I want to edit a custom road?
Once you have a custom road, you can 'Edit All Instances' with Road Builder to automatically update all of the segments of that road that you've placed on the map.
You can, however, choose to create a new road based on that existing one. This will instead only update the single segment that you selected.
To do that, simply choose the 'Use As Template' option when selecting a segment.

### What are all of these options on the left?
The left panel contains the properties of the road you are editing.
The **Category** section dictates the type of road, which is the same as the 'base' that we mentioned earlier.
The category will generally change what lanes are allowed to be used in the road, it will also change the category where the road is placed in the asset toolbar.

The **Addons** section toggles some extra options available for the road, like having raised sidewalks, zoning, etc…

### Can I combine Subway tracks with other kinds of transportation?
The game does not like to mix Subway networks with other kinds of networks. For this reason, you can’t use Subway lanes in other types of networks by default in Road Builder, however, you can enable “Advanced User Mode” to unlock this restriction.

You will still however need to fiddle around to use those networks in the game.

### Can I make custom bridges with Road Builder?
Bridges that have a unique style are not supported. In the future, there might be minimal support for these kinds of bridges.

### What happens if I share my save-game with someone else?

As long as someone has Road Builder, they will be able to load save-games that contain custom roads in them with no extra steps. It will just work.

### What happens if I use cloud save and load the save-game from another computer?

Just like sharing save-games, you can load your save-game on another computer with no extra steps. However, you might run into an issue where road configurations are duplicated because roads are still saved locally. A good idea would be to turn on “Only save used roads” in the Road Builder options.

### How can I share roads with someone else?

Sharing roads is possible, but it is a manual process for now. You can find your road configurations inside:
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\RoadBuilder

Copy the selected road files from your computer to the same location on the other user’s computer. Then they will find the roads in their game automatically.
